The Wa-\/\+Tor Simulation project is a C++ implementation of a predator/prey ecosystem. It shows the interactions between fish and sharks within a grid, focusing on their behaviors, breeding patterns, and the impact of environmental factors. The project is creating use c++ and incorporates parallelization using Open\+MP.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}

The Wa-\/\+Tor Simulation project includes a set of constants, functions, and the main program. The constants define parameters such as initial populations, breeding times, and starvation thresholds. The functions contai various aspects of the simulation, from moving entities (fish, sharks) to updating the world based on rules. The main function carries out the simulation, integrating initialization, updates, rendering, and performance measurement for threads.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Issues}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
Sharks do not always populate on the first run of the simulation. The program may need to run two or three times to see an increase in shark population.
